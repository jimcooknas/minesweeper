This is another version of the legendary game of <b>minesweeper</b>.<br>
My effort was inspired from a Daniel Shiffman's <b>Coding Train</b> project (https://thecodingtrain.com/challenges/71-minesweeper)<br>
The main code was transfered from the <b>Coding Train</b> project, with minor changes and a lot of addings. It is purely Html, CSS, p5.js (javascript).<br>
The user can select the size of the grid (selecting its cell width) and the number of mines (bombs). There is also a timer (as the original one) that counts-down the playing time.<br>
This timer can be altered by the near button (change between 30 to 600 seconds).
Thnaks to Daniel for his beautiful code.<br><br>
